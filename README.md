# jspell
Lazer focussed spell check for the web. "Is this a real word?" That's it. The goal is to be fast enough to run on keystroke.


## Design Log
Keeping track of the evolution over time.

### v0 - Something Working 
The initial plan is to just have a JS array of words and simply check if the given word is in the list and see how fast or slow that is.

## Performance
| Type | Words | Avg | Total |
| :--: | :---: | :-: | :---: |
| v0   |  0K   | 0ms | 0.0s|  

## Getting Started
```
<script src="jspell.js"></script>
